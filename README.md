# CAPRA: Context-Aware Patch Risk Assessment
CAPRA is a Python3-based security detection tool for C/C++ program patches. It analyzes the logical behavioral impact of pending patches on source programs to determine whether incorporating the patch might trigger immature vulnerabilities. 
 Operating environment and main dependencies: 
 1) Python 3.10
 2) Ubuntu 22.04.4
 3) Joern 2.0.4
 4) NetworkX 3.3

CAPRA Usage Instructions
Execute through command line usingï¼špython3 PatchbasedIncrementalDefectDetection.py -p <test file path> -c [1] -d [1] -r [1]
Where -p is the path to the files for analysis, which should contain two folders named 'a' and 'b', storing the source code files before and after modification respectively; -c indicates whether to recreate the code property graph, default value is 0; -d indicates whether to recreate the patch file, default value is 0; -r is used for batch testing. Detailed parameter usage instructions can be obtained through -help.
